# Pochta — architecture & design

Technical deep-dive (the README is the product overview). Companion docs:
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) (wire contract) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (phase
history + what's next). This doc is written to double as an LLM context document —
paste it in and you can reason about the system.

## Tech stack

- **Relay (backend)**: Elixir + Phoenix (channels for signaling/inbox; a small
  HTTP surface for media blobs + serving the SPA). Bandit server.
- **Messaging core**: **`chat_engine`** — a separate Elixir library providing
  ordering (gap-free `seq`), per-device cursors, exactly-once catch-up, presence,
  fan-out, and clustering behind pluggable *ports*. Vendored into the repo
  (`apps/server/vendor/chat_engine`) so builds need no external paths.
- **Storage**: Ecto adapters implementing the engine's ports, over **SQLite**
  (`ecto_sqlite3`, default) or **Postgres** (`postgrex`). Chosen by config.
- **Client SDK**: [`@pochta-chat/sdk`](packages/sdk) — framework- & storage-agnostic
  TypeScript (identity, crypto, transport, ops). Published to npm.
- **Web client**: React + Vite + TypeScript, consuming the SDK.
- **Crypto (client)**: `@noble/curves` (ed25519 + x25519), `@noble/ciphers`
  (xchacha20poly1305), `@noble/hashes`, `@scure/bip39`. WebCrypto (PBKDF2/AES-GCM)
  for the identity vault.
- **Realtime**: WebRTC (RTCPeerConnection, media), STUN/TURN (relay-provided).
- **On-device storage**: IndexedDB (`idb`), encrypted at rest.

  once two peers connect ──► direct P2P WebRTC media for calls (no server)
```

**The model that ties it together — the per-identity inbox.** Each account's inbox
is a single-member `chat_engine` conversation keyed by the public key. Sending to a
contact = `inject` a sealed envelope into *their* inbox; each of their devices is a
`Session` with its own cursor and catches up. Text, receipts, typing, reactions,
edits, media refs, and call signaling are all sealed payloads through this one
path. Calls then establish direct WebRTC media.

*(The Elixir app/modules are still named `signaling` internally — a `pochta`
rename is a pending mechanical follow-up.)*

## Key design decisions (the "why")

- **Text goes through the relay, not P2P.** Offline delivery + multi-device need a
  fan-out/queue point; text is tiny so P2P buys nothing. WebRTC is reserved for
  **calls** (where P2P media matters). Standard messenger split.
- **Per-recipient sealing** (not a shared group key) — simple and correct for 1:1.
  Trade-off: group chat will want sender-keys/MLS.
- **Server = bounded encrypted buffer.** Retention GC (30d) keeps it from being an
  archive; the durable truth is on devices.
- **No "primary" device.** Multi-device truth is the union of devices; because
  messages are immutable + id'd + `seq`-ordered, merges are conflict-free.
- **Storage behind ports** — SQLite for plug-and-play self-host, Postgres for
  scale, zero code change (proves `chat_engine`'s design).
- **Client SDK, not a coupled app.** All client logic lives in `@pochta-chat/sdk`
  with storage/transport injected — so third parties build their own apps on the
  same E2E core (see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)).

## Does the `chat_engine` need changes? (assessment)

Short answer: **no blockers — it's carrying the load well.** Nice-to-haves from
integrating it:

- **Presence change subscription.** We poll presence every 20s; a
  subscribe/notify-on-change API would remove the polling.
- **First-class "mailbox" pattern.** The engine is conversation-centric; our
  per-identity single-member inbox works but bypasses its group features
  (seen-by-N receipts, membership). A documented mailbox mode would fit E2E apps.
- **DX guardrails.** `append/2` (persist only) vs `inject/2` (persist + fan out)
  is an easy footgun; and the in-memory adapter accepts non-binary payloads while
  SQL adapters need binary — enforcing binary everywhere would fail fast.
- **Retention hook.** The engine has no log GC (bodies do it, as we did) — an
  optional retention policy per conversation would be handy.
- **Big one (future):** untrusted-node federation for the volunteer-relay vision —
  a major feature, not a fix.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full backlog (per-device keys, group chat,
TURN, forward secrecy, volunteer mesh, @handles, mobile).
