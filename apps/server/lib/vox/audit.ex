defmodule Vox.Audit do
  @moduledoc """
  Append-only audit trail of admin actions (mint/add/remove/allow/revoke).

  With a single shared `ADMIN_TOKEN` there are no per-admin identities, so "who"
  is as much as that allows: a short fingerprint of the token used plus the client
  IP. This gives attribution ("which token, from where, when, did what") — the
  cheapest meaningful hardening over "no log at all", and the foundation for
  per-admin accounts later.
