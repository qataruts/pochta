  Trust policy for accepting a (signature-verified) federation push, per the
  operator's `:federation_policy` config:

    * `:open`      — accept any relay whose signature verifies (record it for visibility)
    * `:tofu`      — accept + record on first contact; honor revocation
    * `:allowlist` — accept only relays an operator explicitly added (and not revoked)

  A family/company relay wants `:allowlist`; a public volunteer relay wants
  `:open`. Revocation (`revoked_at`) is honored in every mode.

  Decide whether to accept a push signed by `relay_pubkey` claiming `origin`.

  The signature already proved possession of `relay_pubkey`. On FIRST contact we
  also bind pubkey↔origin: fetch `<origin>/federation/identity` and confirm it
  serves the same pubkey — so a relay can't lie about *which* origin it is
  (you're trusting DNS+TLS, the web's existing root). Once bound, later pushes
  short-circuit. Revocation and allowlist are honored on top.
