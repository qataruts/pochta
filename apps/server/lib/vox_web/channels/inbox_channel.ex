defmodule VoxWeb.InboxChannel do
  @moduledoc """
  A user's private mailbox, backed by `chat_engine`.

  Each identity's inbox is a single-member engine conversation (id = the user's
  public key). A connected device runs a `Chat.Session` that catches up any
  missed messages from its cursor on join, then receives live ones. Senders
  `inject` a sealed envelope into the recipient's inbox conversation; the engine
  persists it (gap-free `seq`), delivers live if the recipient is online, and
  replays it on reconnect if not.

  A socket may only open its OWN inbox — the topic key must match the key the
  socket authenticated with. Payloads are sealed; the relay never reads them.
