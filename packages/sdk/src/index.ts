/**
 * @pochta-chat/sdk — the framework-agnostic client SDK for Pochta.
 *
 * Everything a client needs to speak the Pochta protocol: self-owned identity,
 * end-to-end sign-then-seal crypto, the relay transport + message operations,
 * encrypted media, invites, and private-relay enrollment. It ships NO storage
 * engine and NO UI — a host supplies a `Store` (durable history), a `KVStore`
 * (the account vault), the relay URLs, and `ClientEvents` callbacks. That's how
 * the same core runs a browser app, a desktop/mobile app, or a headless bot.
 *
 * The wire contract is specified in PROTOCOL.md (repo root).
